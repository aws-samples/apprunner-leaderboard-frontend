## App Runner Leaderboard Frontend
Note: This is not Production grade and simply meant as a demo


## Description
We will be setting up a leaderboard application which is comprised of two microservices hosted on App Runner. The first microservice is a frontend UI application which has a public endpoint and the second microservice is a backend application which has a private endpoint. The frontend application communicates with the backend application to retrieve leaderboard data. The backend application retrieves the leaderboard data by communicating with an ElastiCache DB in a VPC.
